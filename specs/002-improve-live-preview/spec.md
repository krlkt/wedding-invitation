**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Improve live preview with full-screen view and subdomain uniqueness validation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature involves preview improvements and subdomain validation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Couples using admin dashboard
   ‚Üí Actions: View wedding site preview, register with unique subdomain
   ‚Üí Data: Wedding configuration, subdomain URLs
   ‚Üí Constraints: Subdomain must be unique across all couples
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Custom domain setup: Resolved - will be purchased later after core features complete
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows for preview and registration identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Wedding configuration with subdomain field
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec ready for planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10
- Q: What is the status of custom domain (oialt.com) availability for this feature release? ‚Üí A: Custom domain NOT available now - will be purchased/configured later after most features are complete
- Q: What should happen when a user clicks "View Live Site" before their wedding configuration is fully saved or is incomplete? ‚Üí A: Show error message - "Please save your configuration first" and prevent preview
- Q: When clicking "View Live Site" button, how should the preview page open? ‚Üí A: New browser tab (target="_blank") - user can switch between admin and preview

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a couple managing their wedding invitation site, I want to see a full-screen preview of how my wedding site will look to guests, so that I can verify the design and content before publishing. Additionally, when registering, I want to ensure my chosen subdomain is unique and won't conflict with other couples' sites.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Preview Improvements
1. **Given** I am logged into the admin dashboard, **When** I view the live preview section, **Then** I should see a visual preview of my wedding site with accurate content
2. **Given** I want to see my wedding site in full screen, **When** I click a "View Live Site" button, **Then** I should see my complete wedding site in a new browser tab without admin interface elements, allowing me to switch between admin and preview
3. **Given** I am viewing the preview, **When** I look at the subdomain URL display, **Then** I should see a clear message about custom domain availability instead of a non-functional URL

#### Subdomain Uniqueness
4. **Given** I am registering a new wedding site, **When** the system generates a subdomain from my and my partner's names, **Then** the system must ensure the subdomain is unique across all registered couples
5. **Given** a subdomain collision occurs during generation, **When** the system detects this, **Then** the system must automatically retry with a different variation until a unique subdomain is found
6. **Given** the system cannot generate a unique subdomain after multiple attempts, **When** registration fails, **Then** I should receive a clear error message asking me to try again

### Edge Cases
- What happens when two couples have identical names (e.g., John & Mary)? ‚Üí System generates unique subdomain via random suffix
- How does the system handle special characters in names that could create invalid subdomains? ‚Üí Strip special characters, keep only alphanumeric and hyphens
- What happens if the preview button is clicked before configuration is saved? ‚Üí Show error message "Please save your configuration first" and prevent preview
- How does the system prevent infinite retry loops during subdomain generation? ‚Üí Maximum 5 retry attempts, then fail with clear error message

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Preview Enhancements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a full-screen preview option that displays the complete wedding site without admin interface elements
- **FR-002**: System MUST show couples their wedding site preview using their actual configuration data (names, dates, features, content)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display message indicating shared domain is current, custom subdomain available after domain purchase (e.g., "Your wedding site - Custom subdomain available after domain setup" or "Currently on shared domain: oialt.vercel.app")
- **FR-004**: Couples MUST be able to access the full-screen preview through a dedicated button in the admin dashboard that opens preview in a new browser tab (target="_blank")
- **FR-004a**: System MUST validate configuration is saved before allowing preview access; show error "Please save your configuration first" if unsaved changes exist
- **FR-005**: Preview MUST reflect the current state of the couple's configuration in real-time

#### Subdomain Uniqueness Validation
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce subdomain uniqueness across all wedding configurations
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically generate unique subdomains from couple names during registration
- **FR-008**: System MUST retry subdomain generation with variations when collisions are detected
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent registration if a unique subdomain cannot be generated after reasonable retry attempts
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear error messages to users when subdomain generation fails
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate subdomain availability before attempting database insertion

#### Data Integrity
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain database constraint that prevents duplicate subdomains at the storage level
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle subdomain collision errors gracefully without exposing technical details to users

### Key Entities

- **Wedding Configuration**: Represents a couple's wedding site setup, including subdomain (must be unique), couple names, wedding date, and feature toggles
- **Preview Session**: Represents a couple's authenticated preview viewing session that displays their wedding site configuration without admin interface
