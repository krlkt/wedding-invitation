**Feature Branch**: `009-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to add a new feature where I can edit content of all the sections. This branch will add content management of the "Hero" section in /admin page. Please do all of this acceptance criteria.

Acceptance Criteria

Hero Content is renamed to "Starting section"

Starting section can use image or video as its background

Starting section can edit groom's and bride's name

where X, Y, Z, and A is editable through an input form (use shadcn)

Starting section can toggle "Show wedding date"

Data is fetched from basic info. If it is undefined, show "1 January 2050" instead as placeholder"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Content management for "Starting section" (formerly "Hero") in admin page
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Admin users
   ‚Üí Actions: Edit content, toggle visibility, configure background media
   ‚Üí Data: Names, parent information, wedding date, background media
   ‚Üí Constraints: Data fallback to basic info, placeholder date for missing data
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements are clearly specified in acceptance criteria
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow identified: Navigate to admin ‚Üí Configure starting section ‚Üí Preview changes
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Entities: Starting section content, Names, Parent information, Wedding date
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No tech details in requirements (implementation-agnostic)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: When parent names are partially filled (e.g., only groom's parents X and Y are entered, but bride's parents Z and A are empty), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Allow saving and display only the filled parent info (e.g., show "Son of X and Y" but hide bride's parent line)
- Q: What is the maximum file size limit for uploaded background videos? ‚Üí A: 50 MB (moderate quality, reasonable size)
- Q: Should there be a maximum file size limit for uploaded background images as well? ‚Üí A: Yes, 10 MB (consistent with web best practices for images)
- Q: When the user changes the background media (e.g., replaces an existing image with a video), what should happen to the previously uploaded file? ‚Üí A: Ask user to confirm deletion before removing old file

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a wedding administrator, I want to customize the starting section (hero area) of my wedding invitation website so that it displays the correct couple's names, optional parent information, wedding date, and personalized background media (image or video), creating a beautiful first impression for our guests.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am on the admin page with the "Starting section" configuration open, **When** I edit the groom's name and bride's name fields, **Then** the names should be saved and displayed on the preview
2. **Given** I am configuring the starting section, **When** I toggle "Show 'Son of X and Y' and 'Daughter of Z and A'" to enabled, **Then** I should see four input fields (X, Y, Z, A) where I can enter parent names
3. **Given** I have enabled parent information display and filled in all four parent names, **When** I save the configuration, **Then** the starting section should display "Son of [X] and [Y]" for the groom and "Daughter of [Z] and [A]" for the bride
4. **Given** I am configuring the starting section, **When** I toggle "Show wedding date" to enabled, **Then** the wedding date should be fetched from basic info and displayed
5. **Given** wedding date is enabled but no date exists in basic info, **When** the section renders, **Then** "1 January 2050" should be displayed as a placeholder
6. **Given** I am selecting background media, **When** I choose either an image or video file, **Then** the selected media should be set as the background for the starting section
7. **Given** the admin page is loaded, **When** I navigate to the content management area, **Then** the section should be labeled "Starting section" (not "Hero Content")
8. **Given** I am replacing an existing background media file, **When** I select a new file, **Then** the system should prompt me to confirm deletion of the old file before proceeding
9. **Given** I upload a background video exceeding 50 MB or an image exceeding 10 MB, **When** the upload is attempted, **Then** the system should reject the file and display a clear error message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when parent information toggle is disabled after parent names were previously saved? (Should hide the display without deleting saved data)
- How does the system handle when a user uploads a very large video file? (System rejects files exceeding 50 MB with a clear error message)
- What happens when basic info is completely empty (no wedding date defined)? (Should show placeholder "1 January 2050")
- How does the system behave if only some parent names are filled (e.g., X and Y but not Z and A)? (System allows partial saves and displays only the filled parent information, hiding empty parent lines)
- What happens when user replaces existing background media with a new file? (System prompts user to confirm deletion of old file before replacing)

- **Basic Info**: Existing entity containing wedding date; referenced by starting section for date display
- **Background Media**: Represents either an image file or video file used as the background visual for the starting section
