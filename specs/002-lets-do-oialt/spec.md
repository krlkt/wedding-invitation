# Feature Specification: Template-Based Live Preview with Feature Toggle Integration

**Feature Branch**: `OIALT-8-template-preview-integration`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Lets do OIALT-8 Feature ticket. We want to connect the currently existing feature toggle that we show in LivePreview.tsx with the previous wedding invitation (see /app/[location]/InvitationPage.tsx). lets try to connect these LivePreview and create a real wedding invitation instead of only text. Each feature toggle represents the old "section" and should be able to update their content. Keep in mind there will be multiple template in the future and this is our first template"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12
- Q: When a user toggles a feature on/off, should the preview update optimistically (immediately) or wait for backend confirmation? ‚Üí A: Hybrid - Preview updates instantly with optimistic UI, show loading indicator while backend confirms, rollback on error
- Q: When a feature is enabled but has no content (e.g., Gallery enabled but no photos uploaded), what should the preview display? ‚Üí A: Sample/demo content - Show example photos/content to illustrate what the section will look like
- Q: Should the live preview enforce authentication - meaning only authenticated admin users can view it? ‚Üí A: Yes, require auth - Preview only accessible to logged-in admin users with active session
- Q: Which browsers must the live preview support for admin users? ‚Üí A: Modern only - Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (last 2 versions)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a couple managing their wedding website, I want to see a live preview of my wedding invitation that reflects the actual appearance of my guest-facing website (not just placeholder text), so that I can understand exactly how my configuration changes will look to my guests before publishing.

When I enable or disable feature toggles (Love Story, RSVP, Gallery, Prewedding Videos, FAQs, Dress Code, Instagram Link), the live preview should immediately show or hide those sections with their actual content and styling from the real invitation template.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am viewing the admin dashboard with live preview enabled, **When** I toggle the "Love Story" feature on, **Then** the preview displays the Love Story section with the actual timeline content and styling from the invitation template

2. **Given** I am viewing the live preview with "Gallery" feature enabled, **When** I toggle the "Gallery" feature off, **Then** the gallery section immediately disappears from the preview

3. **Given** I have configured custom content (groom/bride names, wedding date, parent names, monogram), **When** I view the live preview, **Then** the preview displays all my custom content in the actual invitation layout, not as placeholder text

4. **Given** I am viewing the live preview, **When** multiple features are enabled (RSVP + Love Story + Gallery), **Then** all enabled sections appear in the correct order matching the guest-facing invitation

5. **Given** I have disabled certain features (FAQs, Dress Code), **When** I view the live preview, **Then** those sections do not appear in the preview at all

6. **Given** the system will support multiple templates in the future, **When** I view the preview, **Then** the preview renders using the selected template (defaulting to Template 1 for this first implementation)

7. **Given** I toggle a feature on/off, **When** the backend request fails or returns an error, **Then** the preview reverts to the previous state and displays an error message

8. **Given** I enable the Gallery feature but have not uploaded any photos yet, **When** I view the preview, **Then** the Gallery section displays with sample/demo photos to illustrate how the section will look once populated

9. **Given** I am not logged in as an admin user, **When** I attempt to access the admin dashboard with live preview, **Then** I am redirected to the login page and cannot view the preview

### Edge Cases
- **All features disabled**: Preview shows hero section (names, date, monogram, parent names) plus non-optional sections (Gift, Wishes, Footer)
- **Feature enabled with no content**: Preview displays sample/demo content appropriate to that section (e.g., sample photos for Gallery, sample timeline for Love Story)
- **Initial loading**: Preview displays loading indicator until configuration data is fetched
- **Very long content**: Preview scrolls naturally within the scaled container
- **Unknown feature toggle**: If a feature exists in database but has no template section, gracefully ignore it (don't break preview)
- **Unauthenticated access**: User attempting to access preview without authentication is redirected to login page
- **Session expires during preview**: User is redirected to login page; unsaved toggle changes are lost
- **Unsupported browser**: Admin users on older/unsupported browsers may experience degraded functionality or visual issues (no explicit browser check required)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST render live preview using the actual invitation template components (from InvitationPage.tsx), not simplified placeholder text
- **FR-002**: System MUST respect all feature toggle states (love_story, rsvp, gallery, prewedding_videos, faqs, dress_code, instagram_link) when rendering the preview
- **FR-003**: Preview MUST conditionally show/hide sections based on feature toggle state (enabled = visible, disabled = hidden)
- **FR-004**: Preview MUST display all wedding configuration content (groom/bride names, date, parent names, monogram, footer text, Instagram link) in the actual template styling
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain section ordering consistent with the guest-facing invitation template
- **FR-006**: Preview MUST support template selection architecture to enable multiple templates in the future (this feature implements Template 1)
- **FR-007**: Preview MUST update using optimistic UI pattern - sections appear/disappear instantly (<100ms perceived) while backend confirmation happens in background with subtle loading indicator
- **FR-008**: Preview MUST display a loading state while fetching initial configuration data
- **FR-009**: When a feature is enabled but content is missing or incomplete, preview MUST display sample/demo content that illustrates how the section will appear once populated (e.g., sample photos for Gallery, sample timeline entries for Love Story)
- **FR-010**: Hero section (names, date, monogram, parent names) MUST always be visible regardless of feature toggle states
- **FR-011**: Preview scaling and styling MUST be optimized for dashboard viewing (scaled down, shadow, rounded corners as in current LivePreview)
- **FR-012**: Preview header MUST show subdomain, publish status, and browser window controls (as in current LivePreview)
- **FR-013**: When backend confirmation fails, preview MUST rollback to previous state and display error message to user
- **FR-014**: Non-optional sections (Gift, Wishes, Footer) MUST always be visible in preview regardless of feature toggle states
- **FR-015**: System MUST require authenticated admin user with active session to access live preview - unauthenticated users are redirected to login page
- **FR-016**: System MUST validate user authentication before loading preview data or processing feature toggle changes

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Preview MUST feel instantly responsive - perceived latency <100ms when toggling features (optimistic UI), with backend sync completing within 500ms
- **NFR-002**: Preview MUST be responsive within the dashboard container
- **NFR-003**: Code architecture MUST support easy addition of new templates in the future without major refactoring
- **NFR-004**: Authentication validation MUST not introduce noticeable delay to preview loading (session check should be fast)
- **NFR-005**: Preview MUST function correctly in latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (modern browsers only; no legacy browser support required)

### Key Entities

- **Wedding Configuration**: Represents the couple's wedding details (names, date, subdomain, parent names, monogram, footer text, Instagram link, publish status)
- **Feature Toggle**: Represents optional sections that can be enabled/disabled (love_story, rsvp, gallery, prewedding_videos, faqs, dress_code, instagram_link)
- **Template**: Represents a wedding invitation design/layout (future: multiple templates; current: Template 1 based on InvitationPage.tsx)
- **Section**: Represents a distinct area of the invitation (Hero, Love Story, RSVP, Gallery, etc.) that may be conditionally displayed
- **Sample Content**: Demo/placeholder content displayed when a feature is enabled but user has not yet added real content (helps visualize final appearance)
- **Admin User Session**: Authenticated user session required to access admin dashboard and live preview
